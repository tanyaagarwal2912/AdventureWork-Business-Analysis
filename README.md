# AdventureWork-Business-Analysis
This project deals to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, data modelling, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers for a fictional manufacturing company AdventureWorks Cycles using SQL, Power BI
This course is designed to follow the key stages of the business intelligence workflow, and simulate real-world tasks that data professionals encounter on the job:

STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data
In this stage we’ll focus on building automated workflows to extract, transform, and load our project data using Power Query, and explore common data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, table transformations, and more:
Data connectors
Storage & import modes
Query editing tools
Table transformations
Connecting to a database
Extracting data from the web
QA & Profiling tools
Text, numerical, date & time tools
Rolling calendars
Index & conditional columns
Grouping & aggregating
Pivoting & unpivoting
Merging & appending queries
Data source parameters
Importing Excel models

STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model
In stage 2 we’ll review data modeling best practices, introduce topics like cardinality, normalization, filter flow and star schemas, and begin to build our AdventureWorks data model from the ground up:
Database normalization
Fact & dimension tables
Primary & foreign keys
Star & snowflake schemas
Active & inactive relationships
Relationship cardinality
Filter context & flow
